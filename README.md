## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using:
```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using:
```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

## Start applications

```shell script
docker-compose up
```
